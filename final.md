*Investigate attendee <direction>* - Return a boolean (*true* | *false*) of whether the attendee is a goon or not.  
*Lasso goon <direction>* - Causes Wonder Woman to use her lasso of truth on a goon.  
*repeat <number> times* - Repeat code the specified number of times.  
*if / then* - Checks if a condition is *true* and then does something if so.  
*while <boolean>* - Repeated run the code while the boolean is *true*.
